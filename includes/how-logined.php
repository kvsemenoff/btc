				<h2>How are the winner chosen?</h2>
				<span>First, before you announce anything to the public, you need to contact the winner by email.<br> 
					This is for a few reasons:<br>
					<ul>
						<li><span>o make sure the person is eligible to win, meaning they meet any entry requirements stated in your rules and regulations.</span></li>
						<li><span>To make sure it’s OK to use their name in your announcement.</span></li>
						<li><span>To make sure the person responds to claim the prize. You want to be able to announce the winner in a timely fashion, or else entrants will forget or start asking you about it. As a general rule, give 3 - 7 days for the winner to respond to your email before selecting another (be sure to let the original winner know you’re doing so by email).</span></li>
						<li><span>To be sure you’ve run your contest within Facebook’s guidelines (they require you notify your winner before announcing anything on Facebook, as well).</span></li>
					</ul>
				</span>
					<h2>Rules</h2>
					<span>
						Especially if you ran your contest on Facebook, entrants will be checking your Facebook Page more than their email to see if they won. And with Facebook’s update to their promotion guidelines, it’s now totally legal to announce contest winners with a Facebook Post (once you’ve emailed them first).<br>
						Tips for a great Facebook Post announcement:<br>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Thank all of the entrants for helping make the contest a success</span></li>
							<li><span>If the contest asked entrants to submit some user-generated content, such as a photo or video, attach it to the Post</span></li>
							<li><span>Include a short description of the prize (and a photo of it if there is no user-generated content to attach to the Post)</span></li>
							<li><span>Tag the winner</span></li>
							<li><span>Include a link back to the contest: People may not have seen the contest before, so this will let them check it out</span></li>
							<li><span>Say how the winner was chosen: Such as ‘got the most votes’, ‘chosen by a panel of judges’ or ‘by random selection’</span></li>
							<li><span>Let people know when your next contest will be (or that one is ‘coming soon’ if you don’t have one scheduled)</span></li>
						</ul>
